wunderground-arduino-uploader
=============================


Inspired by the Sparkfun weather station project, this code is for an Arduino application that receives weather data from the now-defunct Sparkfun Weather Board (USB Weather Board V3) via XBee, validates the data and then uploads it to Xively. 
This represents the stable version that is a fall back while working on the Wunderground uploader code in a separate respository
